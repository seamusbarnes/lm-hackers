    "# Clean(ish) lm-hackers notebook\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to simplify and streamline the fastai notebook lmS-hackers.ipynb that Jeremy Howard worked through in [A Hackers' Guide to Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU). There is minimal prose and digressions, except to explain parts of the code I didn't previously understand. Also, the openapi seems to have been updated since the youtube video and when the repo was last updated (28th September 2023)."
